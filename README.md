# Vishal Chavan

DevOps and Cloud Engineering fresher focused on designing reliable, secure, and maintainable AWS infrastructure. I work primarily with Linux systems and Infrastructure as Code, with an emphasis on understanding system behavior, failure modes, and long-term scalability rather than surface-level deployments.

---

## Current focus

- Building AWS infrastructure using Terraform with strong attention to VPC design, subnetting, routing, security groups, and EC2
- Practicing infrastructure automation through hands-on experimentation and iterative improvement
- Strengthening Linux administration, networking, and troubleshooting skills
- Exploring CI/CD fundamentals and deployment workflows

I intentionally break and rebuild infrastructure to understand how systems fail and how to design them more cleanly.

---

## Engineering interests

- Cloud infrastructure automation  
- AWS-based architecture design  
- DevOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines  
- Production-oriented system design  

I prefer working on projects that resemble real-world environments rather than demo-style implementations.
